**MaPP Abroad** is our initiative to connect with students beyond those served
by our [campus partners](/campuses/), by providing engaging mathematical
content to support programs across the world.

MaPP is proud to support the Maths Camp in Kyoto, Japan in 2016 and 2017.
More details are coming soon.
