Do you have a puzzle design that will get middle or high school students
engaged with a mathematical idea? We welcome contributions from anyone who
wants to support our mission of getting kids having fun doing mathematics!

Here are a few specifications for what we're looking for.

- The puzzle should have a **direct link to mathematics** outside the usual
  arithmetic-to-calculus sequence. Your puzzle should introduce
  a totally new mathematical idea to a large majority of high school students.
  Your source material might be a topic usually first introduced to
  upperclassman math majors (e.g. number theory, topology) or inspired by
  a mathematical topic in industry.
- However, the text of your puzzle
  **need not reference the mathematics explicitly**. In fact, it's
  often preferable to structure your puzzle so players will implicitly
  discover mathematical ideas for themselves when solving, without being
  overloaded with lots of technical jargon and definitions.
- You should provide a **short writeup** of the mathematics involved.
  It should be long enough to motivate the puzzle's mathematical connection
  and provide references for teachers/students who wish to connect the
  puzzle and its solution to the mathematics, but
  no longer than two pages.
- The solution to the puzzle should be an **extractable secret message**.
  In the MaPP Challenge, puzzles are solved when this message is reported to
  Game Control. In addition to providing a mechanic for marking puzzles as
  solved during competition, the hidden meaning of the puzzle also provides
  extra motivation to solve. This might be achieved by using an alphanumeric
  code where A=1, B=2, etc., or perhaps using a code like
  [Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) or
  [Morse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code).

If you're interested, email [Dr. Steven Clontz](/about/people/) to get
started! Examples of puzzles we've used in previous events may be found
on our [Puzzles](/puzzles) page.

All puzzles used by MaPP in its programs will be eventually
[open-sourced](/open) under a permissive license, so we ask that all
contributions be compatibly licensed before we can use them
in our programs. Our goal is to share the joy of mathematical problem-solving
with as many people as possible, so we appreciate your support!
