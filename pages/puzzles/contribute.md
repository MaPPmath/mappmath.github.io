Do you have a puzzle design that will get middle or high school students
engaged with a mathematical idea? We welcome contributions from anyone who
wants to support our mission of getting kids having fun doing mathematics!

Generally, mathematicians are encouraged to contribute **Main Puzzles**,
while general audience puzzle designers will find our **Cryptic Puzzles**
to be more similar to the genre they are used to. Specifications for
each are outlined below.

### Main Puzzles

- The puzzle should have a **direct link to mathematics** outside the usual
  arithmetic-to-calculus sequence. Your puzzle should introduce
  a totally new mathematical idea to a large majority of high school students.
  Your source material might be a topic usually first introduced to
  upperclassman math majors (e.g. number theory, topology) or inspired by
  a mathematical topic in industry.
- However, the text of your puzzle
  **need not reference the mathematics explicitly**. In fact, it's
  often preferable to structure your puzzle so players will implicitly
  discover mathematical ideas for themselves when solving, without being
  overloaded with lots of technical jargon and definitions.
- The solution to the puzzle should be an **extractable secret message**.
  In the MaPP Challenge, puzzles are solved when this message is reported to
  Game Control. In addition to providing a mechanic for marking puzzles as
  solved during competition, the hidden meaning of the puzzle also provides
  extra motivation to solve. This might be achieved by using a simple
  alphanumeric code where A=1, B=2, etc., or perhaps using a code like
  [Braille](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braille) or
  [Morse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morse_code). More advanced
  extractions might be better appropriate for a Cryptic Puzzle 
  (see below).
- You should be able to provide a **short writeup of the mathematics** involved.
  It should be long enough to motivate the puzzle's mathematical connection
  and provide references for teachers/students who wish to connect the
  puzzle and its solution to the mathematics, but
  no longer than two pages.

### Cryptic Puzzles

- For those familiar with such events, our Cryptic Puzzles are
  close to the style and difficulty found in Puzzled Pint or
  DASH (Different Area Same Hunt) events.
- The puzzle must solve to an **extractable secret message**.
- These puzzles must be **solvable with negligible outside knowledge**.
  For example, crosswords are not acceptable since they require
  trivia or wordplay knowledge, but a Sudoku variant would be fine.
  Word-based puzzles such as
  Places Please or a criss-cross where all the words are provided
  do not contradict this rule.
- The puzzle must **not be a simple construction of a known puzzle type**.
  For example, a criss-cross from a list of mathy words probably
  isn't acceptable, but could be made acceptable if an extra step was
  required (such as converting letters to Braille). 

## Get in touch

If you're interested, email a brief abstract to
[Dr. Steven Clontz](/about/people/) to get
started! Examples of puzzles we've used in previous events may be found
on our [Puzzles](/puzzles) page.

All puzzles used by MaPP in its programs will be eventually
[open-sourced](/open) under a permissive license, so we ask that all
contributions be compatibly licensed before we can use them
in our programs. (Basically, you need to tell us we have permission
to reuse your contribution in our events, and that teachers will
have permission to use them in their schools.)
Our goal is to share the joy of mathematical problem-solving
with as many people as possible, so we appreciate your support!
