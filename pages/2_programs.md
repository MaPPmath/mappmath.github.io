# MaPP Challenge

Modeled after puzzle competitions like the *MIT Mystery Hunt* and
*DASH (Different Area Same Hunt)*,
the **[MaPP Challenge](/programs/challenge)** engages middle and high school
students with fun and engaging mathematical puzzles and games at our
[host campuses](/campuses) across the country.

# MaPP Circle

To support our [campuses](/campuses) that wish to use MaPP-style puzzles
in their outreach and math circle programs, our
**[MaPP Circle](/programs/circle)** program
provides content for math departments to use when connecting
with local middle and high school students outside of the annual
MaPP Challenge.
