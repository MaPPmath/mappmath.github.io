# Teaching students through mathematical puzzles

The mission of Mathematical Puzzle Programs (MaPP) is to organize quality events
which get students having fun by learning and using mathematics.

## Math

Our mathematical content is pulled from various areas unrepresented in the
usual secondary curriculum, such as design theory, game theory, or topology.

## Puzzles

We shredded the multiple choice tests, and instead designed several
mathematical puzzles which will give your students a taste of real
mathematical problem solving, and prepare them for the types of questions
asked in many job interviews.

## Team-building

MaPP features a team-based competitions, emphasizing collaboration and
communication over individual work, as teamwork is crucial for success in
both industry and academia.

## Fun!

Many of the challenges can't be solved sitting down - players will find
themselves running around their host campus to track down clues and
uncover new puzzles to solve.


# Supports Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice

Successful players in MaPP events will...

1. Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.

2. Reason abstractly and quantitatively.

3. Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.

4. Model with mathematics.

5. Use appropriate tools strategically.

6. Attend to precision.

7. Look for and make use of structure.

8. Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

# MaPP and Research

One of the goals of Mathematical Puzzle Programs is to connect middle and
high school students with mathematical research. In the past, MaPP programs
have included puzzles based upon topology, game theory, design theory, and
many other fields. By introducing these topics in the context of a mathematical
puzzle competition, students are motivated to grapple with the material
in order to discover the hidden messages within.
