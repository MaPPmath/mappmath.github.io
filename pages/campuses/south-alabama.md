<!-- ## What is this about?

To try out a MaPP-style puzzle, download and print the
[High School Challenge '17 teaser puzzle][teaser]. You can also download the
[High School Challenge '16 game book][hsc16book]. More information on
MaPP puzzles can be found at MaPP's [puzzles](/puzzles/) page.

No advanced mathematical background is required for these puzzles, so this
event is appropriate for both proficient and less-experienced secondary
mathematics students.
