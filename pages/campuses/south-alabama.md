The University of South Alabama's
[Department of Mathematics and Statistics][south]
has partnered with
[Mathematical Puzzle Programs][mapp]
to bring fun mathematical events to its campus in beautiful
Mobile, AL. Students participating in MaPP
events will solve puzzles, break codes, and engage with new areas of real
mathematics used in academia and industry!

### MaPP Challenge '18: Gotta Solve 'Em All!

Our 2017-18 **[MaPP Challenge][challenge]** puzzlehunt
will be held at South on **2018 January 27**.

#### Schedule

#### Teaser Puzzle

Is this your first MaPP Challenge? Are you looking for a warm-up puzzle?
Try out our [Challenge '18 teaser puzzle][teaser]!
More puzzles may be found at [MaPP's Puzzles page][puzzles].

#### ClueKeeper App

Each team must provide at least one smart device with GPS, cellular internet
access, and the [ClueKeeper app][cluekeeper] installed. Submitting solutions
and finding hidden locations on campus will be done via this app.
A smartphone belonging to a student will likely serve this purpose.
Please contact [Ms. Kristal Webb][webb] for assistance.

#### Campus Map

MaPP Challenge '18 will be run within the area bounded by University Blvd,
USA North Dr, and USA South Dr as pictured on [this map][south-map].
Players will need to check-in to certain locations on campus during the
first hour of the game; the rest of the game
(including check-in and orientation) will be held in the Humanities Building
(different from last year).

In particular, teachers should not bring students they do not trust to
explore this portion of South's campus without direct supervision.
Students remain the responsibility of their teacher during this event.
