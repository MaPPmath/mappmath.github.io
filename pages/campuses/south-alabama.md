The University of South Alabama's
[Department of Mathematics and Statistics][south]
has partnered with
[Mathematical Puzzle Programs][mapp]
to bring fun mathematical events to its campus in beautiful
Mobile, AL. Students participating in MaPP
events will solve puzzles, break codes, and engage with new areas of real
mathematics used in academia and industry!

### MaPP Challenge '18: Gotta Solve 'Em All!

Our 2017-18 **[MaPP Challenge][challenge]** puzzlehunt
will be held at South on **2018 January 27**. The game is currently scheduled
to run between 10am and 4pm that Saturday. More updates (including registration)
to come;

#### Registration

To field one or more teams from your school, please complete our
[online registration form][registration]. The deadline for registration
is December 4, but space is limited and early registrations will be given
preference if we run out of room. We will try to accommodate as many schools
and teams as possible.

#### Cost

The first team from each school costs $100 (includes lunch for all players
and chaperones). Additional teams cost $50 each.
Payment is due after registration closes and participation is confirmed.
Failure to arrange payment in a timely fashion may result in being replaced by
a waitlisted school.

The fee for a second team will be waived for schools
that invite South's Math/Stat Outreach committee to visit their school for a
presentation on academics, careers, and puzzles related to mathematics and
statistics. For more information, contact Paul Jones at
<pauljones@southalabama.edu>.
