The **MaPP Challenge** is an annual puzzlehunt designed to challenge
7th through 12th grade students' mathematical problem solving abilities.
These [puzzles](/puzzles/) are inspired on ideas outside the usual
arithmetic-to-calculus sequence, so advanced mathematical coursework
isn't necessary to enjoy the game!
These events are ran at our [partner campuses](/campuses/) across the country
between October and April each school year.

**Think you have what it takes?** Check out our [Puzzles](/puzzles/) for
examples of the challenges you'll tackle in the MaPP Challenge!

## MaPP Challenge '18

**MaPP Challenge '18: Gotta Solve 'Em All!** will be run throughout the
2017-18 academic year at our [partner campuses](/campuses/) across the country.

For an introduction to this year's Challenge and an example puzzle,
we've provided a simple
[teaser puzzle](/puzzles/mapp-challenge-18-teaser-puzzle.pdf).

# About the MaPP Challenge

The MaPP Challenge is a team-based mathematical puzzle
competition for high school students held at multiple college campuses across
the country. Unlike traditional math competitions, our puzzlehunt
rewards players’ problem-solving ability over their
previous mathematical background, pulling ideas from outside the usual
arithmetic-to-calculus sequence.

### Puzzles

MaPP shredded the multiple choice tests, and instead designed several
mathematical puzzles which will give your students a taste of real mathematical
problem solving. Rather than solving for X, players will be challenged with
cracking codes and uncovering hidden messages using their critical
thinking and inginuity.

### Team-building

The MaPP Challenge is a team-based competition, emphasizing collaboration and
communication over individual work, as teamwork is crucial for success in both
industry and academia.

### Fun!

These challenges won’t all be solved sitting down – many locations hide
clues across campus, giving players the opportunity to explore and connect
with the host institution.

# Why should my school participate?

In addition to all of the above, MaPP designs its programs to fit the
[Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice:][common core]

[common core]: http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/

Successful players will...

- Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
- Model with mathematics.
- Use appropriate tools strategically.
- Attend to precision.
- Look for and make use of structure.
- Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

# What will players do at the MaPP Challenge?

There are a few stages to the game:

### Opening Puzzle

The game begins with a mathematical challenge which will get
players up and running for the day's puzzles.

### Main Puzzles

Teams are posed several mathematics-inspired Main Puzzles, each of
which solves to a hidden word or phrase.

### Bonus Puzzles

Bonus Puzzles are optimization-based challenges designed to

### Cryptic Puzzles

Players who uncover the mathematical ideas in the Main Puzzles are
given the chance to tackle one or more
Cryptic Puzzles. The methods of extracting their solutions aren't
straight-forward, so players will enjoy puzzling out the hidden meanings of
these challenges.

### Metapuzzle

By piecing together the clues and solutions gathered throughout the game,
players may be able to crack the code of the Metapuzzle.

### And more?

Hey, you never know.

# Who can be on a team?

Depending on your campus, up to eight students may form a team. Of
course, teams with more students will be more competitive. Most campuses allow
each school to field up to two teams, each of which must have a teacher or
chaperone on site.

Students with experience solving mathematical puzzles will have an advantage in
competition, but this team-based event can be enjoyed by most students
regardless of background. Our hope is that this event will convince students who
don't already love math to broaden their horizons a little, and gain a new
appreciation for what math can be.

---

# What kinds of puzzles are these? How should we practice?

Students will have fun regardless of their previous experience with math
puzzles. However, competitive teams may want to try their hand at solving
the problems made available on our [Puzzles](/puzzles) page.

# What does it cost? What is the schedule?

Details related to registration fees and scheduling vary for each
[campus](/campuses/). Visit your campus's website for details.

# I'm interested in running the MaPP Challenge at my campus. What should I do?

To get involved with Mathematical Puzzle Programs, email
[Dr. PJ Couch](/about/people/) and we'll be excited to connect you with
an existing campus nearby! The best way to learn about this event is to
experience it for yourself, and we'd love to get you in the loop.
