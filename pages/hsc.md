Our **High School Challenge** is an annual puzzlehunt designed to challenge
9th through 12th grade students' mathematical problem solving abilities.
Students should be familiar with basic algebra and geometry, but otherwise
do not require any formal coursework in mathematics.
Our [hosts](/campuses/) across the country run this competition between
September and April each school year.
