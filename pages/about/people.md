# Director

![clontz](/img/steven-clontz.jpg)

**Dr. Steven Clontz**, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of
South Alabama, has been an active puzzle competitor and designer since 2009. In
addition to Dr. Clontzâ€™s work with MaPP, his credits include several general
audience puzzle events across the United States, including partnerships with
escape room businesses and the National Museum of Mathematics.

As director of
MaPP, Dr. Clontz oversees the design of quality mathematical puzzle content for
our various programs.
In particular, Dr. Clontz strives to find ways to take mathematical research,
including his own work in topology and game theory, and make it accessible to
high school students by applying the same concepts in many of MaPP's puzzles.
He also loves to duplicate the fun of MaPP's programs in his classroom by
employing he same philosophy of active inquiry and team-based learning in his
courses.
