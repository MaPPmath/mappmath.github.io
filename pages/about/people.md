# Director of Games and Puzzles

![clontz](http://www.gravatar.com/avatar/2f9ecf8e56d48c8fd7adff7a8b5400bb?size=400)

**Dr. Steven Clontz**, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University of
South Alabama, has been an active puzzle competitor and designer since 2009. In
addition to Dr. Clontzâ€™s work with MaPP, his credits include several general
audience puzzle events around the world, including partnerships with
international puzzlehunt competitions, escape room businesses,
and the National Museum of Mathematics.

Dr. Clontz strives to find ways to take mathematical research,
including his own work in topology and game theory, and make it accessible to
high school students by applying the same concepts in many of MaPP's puzzles.
He also loves to duplicate the fun of MaPP's programs in his classroom by
employing the same philosophy of active inquiry and team-based learning in his
courses.

Southern Connecticut State University, is co-author of the 
Inquiry-Based Learning
textbook [Investigating Discrete Mathematics][ibl-textbook].
Dr. Carrigan has traveled the country and world promoting mathematics 
through  puzzles, including serving several mathematics camps in 
Australia. This experience led to a partnership with Dr. Clontz 
to co-found the the world's first mathematical puzzlehunt competition, 
the [A.M.P.'d Challenge][ampd], at Auburn University in 2012.
Dr. Carrigan is a professional development organizer and presenter for 
the GeoGebra Institute of Southern Connecticut, served on the 
organizational team for New Haven Math County Math Teacher Circles, 
and received a MAA-DMEG grant supporting the MaPP Challenge 
at SCSU.

As an instructor of many pre-service teachers at
his university, Dr. Carrigan utilizes mathematical puzzles in the classroom 
as an introduction to studying theoretical mathematics.


# Director of Campuses

**Dr. PJ Couch**,  Distinguished Faculty Teaching Fellow and 
Associate Professor of Mathematics at Lamar University,
established the Lamar Mathematical Puzzlehunt in 2015, which served as the
pilot event for the MaPP's Challenge. Dr. Couch also sponsored the
first MaPP Middle School Challenge at Lamar University. He coordinates
MaPP's partner campuses, including onboarding our new partners each year.
