The following branding and style guide has been developed to help our
partner [campuses](/campuses/) accurately represent Mathematical Puzzle
Programs by clearly communicating who we are and what we do.

## Our Organization

Our organization is **Mathematical Puzzle Programs**, or **MaPP** for
short. We are an ad hoc collective of mathematicians and puzzle enthusiasts
who aim to encourage young people to engage in mathematical problem-solving
by organizing puzzle events at locations across the United States and
elsewhere. At this time we are not an officially incorporated non-profit
organization, but we are not a business and do not operate for the profit
of any of our associated members.

Our partner campuses are encouraged to represent their relationship
with MaPP as follows, using the **University of South Alabama** (officially
abbreviated as **South**) as an example. You can refer
to your school's branding guide for more information as well.

- Mathematical Puzzle Programs at the University of South Alabama
- MaPP at the University of South Alabama
- The University of South Alabama,
  in partnership with Mathematical Puzzle Programs
- #MaPPatSouth

Our web domain and social media accounts use **MaPPmath** to
differentiate us from other brands using the acronym MAPP.

## Our Programs

Our puzzlehunt program is the **MaPP Challenge**. When referring to a specific
game, the year (using the spring of the academic year) is used with an
apostrophe, e.g. **MaPP Challenge '18**. The apostrophe is not used when
abbreviating to hashtag, e.g. **#Challenge18**.

Our outreach program is the **MaPP Circle**.

Historically, MaPP organized two puzzlehunts: **High School Challenge**
(**HSC** for short) and **Middle School Challenge** (**MSC** for short).
When referring to a specific instance
of a program, the last two digits of the following spring preceded by
an apostrophe are used;
for example, the High School Challenge run during the 2016-17 school
year is called the **High School Challenge '17**. When abbreviated,
the apostrophe is not used, e.g. **HSC17**.
