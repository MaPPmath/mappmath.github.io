The following branding and style guide has been developed to help our
partner [campuses](/campuses/) accurately represent Mathematical Puzzle
Programs by clearly communicating who we are and what we do.

## Our Organization

Our organization is **Mathematical Puzzle Programs**, or **MaPP** for
short. We are an ad hoc collective of mathematicians and puzzle enthusiasts
who aim to encourage young people to engage in mathematical problem-solving
by organizing puzzle events at locations across the United States and
elsewhere. At this time we are not an officially incorporated non-profit
organization, but we are not a business and do not operate for the profit
of any of our associated members.

Our partner campuses are encouraged to represent their relationship
with MaPP as follows, using the **University of South Alabama** (officially
abbreviated as **South**) as an example. You can refer
to your school's branding guide for more information as well.

- Mathematical Puzzle Programs at the University of South Alabama
- MaPP at the University of South Alabama
- The University of South Alabama,
  in partnership with Mathematical Puzzle Programs
- #MaPPatSouth

Our web domain and social media accounts use **MaPPmath** to
differentiate us from other brands using the acronym MAPP.

## Our Programs

Currently, our two programs are the **High School Challenge** (**HSC** for
short) and **Middle School Challenge** (**MSC** for short).
When referring to a specific instance
of a program, the last two digits of the following spring preceded by
an apostrophe are used;
for example, the High School Challenge run during the 2016-17 school
year is called the **High School Challenge '17**. When abbreviated,
the apostrophe is not used, e.g. **HSC17**.

The first usage of any of our programs should be preceded by
**Mathematical Puzzle Programs** or **MaPP** to clearly associate
the program with our organization, but avoid letter soup such as
"MaPP HSC17". Here are some variations of
how to refer to High School Challenge '17 when run at
the University of South Alabama.

- Mathematical Puzzle Programs' High School Challenge '17
- MaPP High School Challenge '17 at the University of South Alabama
- HSC17, presented by South
- #HSC17atSouth

In particular, do **not** use variations of "MaPP Challenge", since
this phrasing does not clearly designate either our high school or
middle school event.
