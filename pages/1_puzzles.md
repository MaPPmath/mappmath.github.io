A friend passes you a note with the following strange image.

![Example Puzzle](/img/topology-puzzle.png)

She's recently been interested in **topology**, the study of structures
which can be morphed from one to another without cutting or tearing,
such as the donut and coffee cup shown above.
**Can you decode the number pairs by finding five groups of
topologically-equivalent letters?** Try writing each group in alphabetical
order on the corresponding rows of the grid...

Like in the example above, MaPP puzzles are **fun** challenges
which get students learning and using **advanced mathematics** and
**problem-solving skills**.
