A friend passes you a note with the following strange image.

![Example Puzzle](/img/topology-puzzle.png)

She explains that several of the letters can be morphed
from one to another without adding new edges,
joining new points together, or cutting edges apart.
For example, the A and E in her note can be morphed back and forth
because both contain exactly one loop joined with an edge.
**Can you decode the number pairs by identifying groups of letters than can
be "morphed" from one to another?**  Try writing each group in alphabetical
order on the corresponding rows of the grid...

Like in the example above, MaPP puzzles are **fun** challenges
which get students learning and using **mathematics** and
**problem-solving skills**, by engaging them with mathematical ideas outside the
usual arithmetic-to-calculus sequence.
