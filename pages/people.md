# Our Volunteers

Mathematical Puzzle Programs is a volunteer effort. We'd like to
thank the following individuals who make this all possible.

# National Volunteers

## Director of Mathematics, Puzzles, and Games

**Dr. Steven Clontz**, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at the University
of South Alabama, has been an active puzzle competitor and designer since 2009.
In addition to Dr. Clontz's work with MaPP, his credits include designing
puzzles for the [National Museum of Mathematics](http://momath.org/),
leadership training programs in the Bay Area,
and several puzzlehunt competitions in the southeast United States.
As director of MaPP, Dr. Clontz oversees the design of quality mathematical
puzzle events for middle and high school students across the country.

## Associate Director of Communications  

**Dr. Braxton Carrigan**, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at
Southern Connecticut State University, established the world's first
mathematical puzzlehunt competition, the
[A.M.P.'d Challenge](http://www.auburn.edu/cosam/departments/outreach/programs/AMPd/),
at Auburn University in 2012. Dr. Carrigan has traveled
the world promoting mathematics through puzzles, including serving several
mathematics camps in Australia. As communications director, Dr. Carrigan
coordinates our local volunteers across the country and represents our
work on this website and our newsletters.

## Associate Director of Development

**Dr. PJ Couch**, Assistant Professor of Mathematics at Lamar University,
established the Lamar Mathematical Puzzlehunt in 2015, which served as the
pilot event for MaPP's High School Challenge. Dr. Couch also sponsored the
first MaPP Middle School Challenge at Lamar University. As development
director, Dr. Couch supports campuses new to sponsoring MaPP events, helping
them appropriate resources and work with their stakeholders to bring
mathematical puzzle experiences to young people in their communities.
