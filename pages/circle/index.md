To help our partner [campuses](/campuses/) connect with local students
outside of a [game](/programs/challenge/) setting, our
**MaPP Circle** program is designed to provide extra puzzle materials
for math clubs, math circles, and other outreach opportunities.

For more information, contact [Dr. Braxton Carrigan](/about/people).
