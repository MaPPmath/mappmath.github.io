To help our partner [campuses](/campuses/) connect with local students
outside of a [game](/programs/challenge/) setting, our
**MaPP Circle** program is designed to provide extra puzzle materials
for math clubs, math circles, and other outreach opportunities.

[Dr. Braxton Carrigan](/about/people) serves as director of this
program and supports local campuses in using MaPP Circle materials.
If you are a secondary school student or teacher, please contact
your closest [MaPP Campus](/campuses/) for more information on MaPP Circle.
