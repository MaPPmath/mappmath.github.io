Our **High School Challenge** is an annual puzzlehunt designed to challenge
9th through 12th grade students' mathematical problem solving abilities.
Students should be familiar with basic algebra and geometry, but otherwise
do not require any formal coursework in mathematics.
These events are ran at our [partner campuses](/campuses/) across the country
between September and April each school year.

**Think you have what it takes?** Give our

# About the MaPP High School Challenge

The MaPP High School Challenge is a team-based mathematical puzzle
competition for high school students held at multiple college campuses across
the country. Unlike traditional high school math competitions, HSC doesn’t
require any knowledge
beyond basic algebra and rewards players’ problem-solving ability over their
previous mathematical background.

MaPP’s mathematical content is pulled from various areas unrepresented in the
usual secondary curriculum, such as design theory, game theory, or topology.

### Puzzles

MaPP shredded the multiple choice tests, and instead designed several
mathematical puzzles which will give your students a taste of real mathematical
problem solving, and prepare them for the types of questions asked in many job
interviews.

### Team-building

MaPP HSC is a team-based competition, emphasizing collaboration and
communication over individual work, as teamwork is crucial for success in both
industry and academia.

### Fun!

These challenges won’t all be solved sitting down – players will find themselves running around UNC Charlotte’s campus to track down clues and uncover new puzzles to solve.

# Why should my school participate?

In addition to all of the above, MaPP has designed its events to fit the
[Common Core State Standards for Mathematical Practice:][common core]

[common core]: http://www.corestandards.org/Math/Practice/

Successful players will...

- Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.
- Reason abstractly and quantitatively.
- Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others.
- Model with mathematics.
- Use appropriate tools strategically.
- Attend to precision.
- Look for and make use of structure.
- Look for and express regularity in repeated reasoning.

# What will players do at a High School Challenge?

There are a few stages to the game:

### Opening Puzzle

The game begins with a mathematical challenge which will get
players running around the host campus to solve their first puzzle
of the day!

### Main Puzzles

Teams are given a packet of several mathematical puzzles, each of
which solves to a codeword or phrase.

### Bonus Puzzles

Each Main Puzzle unlocks a related Bonus Puzzle. Players should try
to optimize their solutions to beat out the competition!

### Metapuzzle

Players will collect pieces to the Metapuzzle throughout the game.
Bring these clues together to solve the most challenging puzzle of
them all!

### And more?

Hey, you never know.

# Who can be on a team?

Five to eight high school students (9th through 12th grade) may form a team,
and teams with more students will be more competitive. Most campuses allow
each school to field up to two teams, each of which must have a teacher or
chaperone on site.

Students with experience solving mathematical puzzles will have an advantage in
competition, but this team-based event can be enjoyed by most students
regardless of background. Our hope is that this event will convince students who
don't already love math to broaden their horizons a little.

# What kinds of puzzles are these? How should we practice?

Students will have fun regardless of their previous experience with math
puzzles. However, competitive teams may want to try their hand at solving
problems from previous games:
