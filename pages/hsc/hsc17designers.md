Thank you for your interest in designing a puzzle for **Mathematical Puzzle
Program's (MaPP) High School Challenge '17 (HSC17)**! We provide our
mathematical puzzlehunt competition materials to campuses across the
country without cost as part of our mission of promoting the fun of
mathematical problem solving. Your contributions are what make this
possible.

Please read this short document outlining what we need from our volunteer
designers.

## Program overview

HSC17 will run at multiple college campuses across the country
throughout the 2016-17 school year (September to April).
As such, we need commitments from our designers by
**Friday, 2016 June 17** and a playtest-ready version submitted
by **Friday, 2017 July 15**. Materials should be kept secret
until the final event runs in April 2017, after which you
are welcome to host your contribution on your own site or use
it in another context (see Licensing below).
We will schedule a Google Hangout or phone call to discuss details
before you're officially committed.


## Puzzle specifications

We are primarily
seeking variable-scoring mathematical puzzles. Examples of these
can be found in the [HSC16 puzzle booklet][booklet], listed as
"EXTRA Puzzles". Within the game, the team(s) earning the highest
score on each EXTRA Puzzle compared to all other teams at their campus
will earn a fixed number of victory points.

[booklet]: https://github.com/MaPPmath/hsc16/raw/master/booklet.pdf

Players are 9th-12th graders. As such, we require that your puzzles
assume nothing beyond basic algebra and geometry, and prefer puzzles
that do not give a distinct advantage to students with knowledge
of advanced high school algebra or calculus.

We do not have a fixed definition of what makes a puzzle
"mathematical". The goal of these puzzles are to reward
problem-solving skills and mathematical modeling of abstract
problems. If your puzzle has a connection to a mathematical field
(e.g. number theory, topology, etc.) all the better, but
such connections are not required and need not be made explicit.

Here are a few things to avoid:

* Prior knowledge such as trivia or wordplay (unless it's from
  a limited and provided vocabulary).
* Cryptic elements. All aspects of these mathematical puzzles should be
  well-defined. (We do include some crytpic elements in other aspects
  of the game, however.)
* Randomness.

We will design a simple puzzle which decodes to a message
based upon the theme of your puzzle. If you'd also like to
design this puzzle yourself, let us know!

## Game Overview

So you have some context for the overall game, here is the structure
for High School Challenge '16 (HSC17 may have some slight changes
which we don't want to spoil publicly). You can also review the
entire [puzzle booklet][booklet] for yourself if you'd like.

* Teams
    * 6-8 high school students
* Puzzles
    * Opening Puzzle (run-around challenge, 30 min)
    * 5 Main Puzzles (solve to short phrases, ~3 hrs total available)
        * 5 Extra Puzzles (optimization-based, unlocked from Main Puzzles)
        * Metapuzzle (hidden cryptic puzzle, based on Main Puzzle solutions)

## Licensing and Credits

MaPP believes in copyleft licensing of our materials. After the
final HSC17 competition is run, we will release all materials
under <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>.
This allows teachers and other mathematical puzzle enthusiasts
the freedom
to reuse MaPP materials in any setting, provided they
give proper attribution to us (and by extension, you).
In order that we may do so, we require that intellectual rights
to all contributions
by volunteers be first transferred to MaPP, or licensed by the
volunteer himself/herself under a compatible license.

We are mathematicians and puzzle designers ourselves, and we
value your contributions highly. As such, we will credit you
on our website and in the released materials. We will also
send a small token of our appreciation to our HSC17 puzzle
designers thanking you for your volunteer efforts.

## In short

* Puzzles should be variable-scoring mathematical puzzles
  appropriate for 9-12th grade students. (We are open to
  other contributions as well!)
* Commit to designing a puzzle by submitting your puzzle concept by
  **Friday, 2016 June 17**. We will schedule a Google Hangout
  or phone call to discuss details before committing.
* Submit a playtest-ready version by **Friday, 2016 July 15**.
* Contributed materials must be kept secret until the last High School
  Challenge '17 competition (no later than May 2017).
* All rights to contributed materials must either be released to
  MaPP, or licensed under
  <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>.
* After the final
  HSC17, the events' puzzle booklet will be released on our website
  under <https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>.
* We will credit your contributions on our website and in all HSC17
  materials, and give you a small token of our appreciation.
