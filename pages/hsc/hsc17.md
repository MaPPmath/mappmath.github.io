**HSC17** will be our second mathematical puzzlehunt, to be run during the
2016-17 school year at our [partner campuses](/campuses/) across the country.

# Information for Schools

**HSC17** is still in the planning stages, but we'll be announcing participating
[campuses](/campuses/) in the coming weeks. Schools may register for a local
HSC event through that host campus's webpage.

**Danielle Dobie** is a recent graduate from Minnesota State University,
Mankato, where she received her Master’s degree in Mathematics.  
She has always had a love for solving and creating puzzles.  The summer
after graduating high school, she created a puzzle book for her
mother that included 78 different puzzles.  
When Ms. Dobie was a senior in college, she created a
scavenger hunt leading her future husband, Bradley, all over Mankato and North
Mankato.  Danielle’s continuous desire to create puzzles for others is what
inspired her to become a puzzle designer for HSC17.

**Christopher Night** [[www][night www]] studied astrophysics and mathematics at Villanova
University and Harvard University, and now works for Google as a software developer
on their flight search service. He once designed a puzzle that appeared in a
